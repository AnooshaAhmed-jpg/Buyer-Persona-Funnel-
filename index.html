  <h1>Buyer Persona & Funnel Strategy</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Buyer Persona</h2>
    <p>Digital marketing builds an online presence through a full funnel strategy.<a href="https://anooshaahmed-jpg.github.io/Digital-Marketing-Funnel/#contact">Digital Marketing Funnel</a>
 Creating a buyer persona helps you understand the behavior of your customers. If you run an e-commerce business, this strategy highlights why your product is useful and how it benefits customers — forming the foundation of your funnel.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>TOFU (Top of the Funnel)</h2>
    <p>TOFU is the first stage where customers discover your product or service for the very first time — often through ads, reels, organic Google results, or social media. The goal here is broad awareness, reaching as many people as possible and guiding them into the next stage.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>MOFU (Middle of the Funnel)</h2>
    <p>MOFU represents the audience that already knows about your products and services. This stage focuses on nurturing their interest, providing them with knowledge, and keeping them engaged so they can move closer to conversion.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>BOFU (Bottom of the Funnel)</h2>
    <p>BOFU is the final stage where customers are ready to take action. This is where they make purchase decisions, subscribe, or sign up. At this stage, clear calls-to-action and strong trust factors are key to turning interest into sales.</p>
